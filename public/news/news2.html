After dipping its toe into the waters of romance, mystery and science fiction publishing, Amazon.com has announced its biggest publishing venture yet with the acquisition of more than 450 children's books from US press Marshall Cavendish – and the revelation that similar deals are likely to follow.

Amazon.com already has six publishing imprints, covering topics from literature in translation to romance, and has also bought rights in a range of individual authors' titles. Last month it paid a reported $500,000 (£320,000) for a memoir from Deepak Chopra and his brother; this summer it bought 35 books by mystery author Ed McBain.

The deal – for an undisclosed sum – with Marshall Cavendish, however, is the online retailer's most dramatic move into publishing yet, and marks its first significant step into children's books. Titles acquired by Amazon include Gennady Spirin's illustration of Clement C Moore's classic poem The Night Before Christmas, National Book Award finalist Debby Dahl Edwardson's novel My Name is Not Easy, Eric A Kimmel's Texas-set retelling of the Three Little Pigs, Three Little Tamales, Bill Thomson's picture book Chalk and Jennifer Roy's story of her aunt's Holocaust experience, Yellow Star. The retailer will continue to publish the books in print as well as making them available digitally, and plans to use the acquisition as a platform for further expansion into picture books, chapter books and young adult novels.

Amazon Publishing vice president Jeff Belle believes the children's book market "presents a unique opportunity to innovate in both print and digital formats". With many of the Marshall Cavendish titles currently unavailable as ebooks, Amazon.com "see[s] a chance to connect a terrific group of authors and illustrators with more readers", he said. "We will continue to publish these books in their handsome print editions and we think customers will love reading these books — most of them never available before digitally — with their families, using the brilliant colour touchscreen on the Kindle Fire," said Laurence Kirshbaum, Amazon's publisher.

Belle said that Amazon.com will now be looking for similar acquisitions from other publishers. "We also see the potential for similar deals across other categories in the future," he said.
