In what could be a landmark moment in the struggle between old versus new technology, Amazon has announced that it now sells more copies of its Kindle ebooks than traditional paperbacks.

The online retailer, in posting its latest financial results, revealed that paid-for sales of the electronic format outstrip its total sales of paperbacks â€“ although combined sales of paperbacks and hardbacks still seem to maintain print's number one spot overall.

Amazon's ambiguous use of figures suggests that the online retailer still sells 120 print books for every 100 ebooks sold. But at this rate it can't be too long before Gutenberg's offspring is dethroned.
The company had previously announced that sales of the third generation version of the Kindle have surpassed sales of JK Rowling's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows as the bestselling single product in the company's history.
